The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?
Sol:
if we take that Alice is telling the truth, is contradictory because if "those who are studied are telling the trut" doesn't make sense with the fact of none has studied.
if we take that Charlie, Dan or Eva are telling the truth, all are contradictory wiht the others sentences. so the only that is telling the truth is Bob.
